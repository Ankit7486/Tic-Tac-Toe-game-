# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players alternate placing their symbol (either an "X" or an "O") in an empty cell on the grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.
